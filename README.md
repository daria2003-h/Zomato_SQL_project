# Zomato_SQL_project
![](https://github.com/daria2003-h/Zomato_SQL_project/blob/main/zomato_picture.jpg)

This project showcases my SQL problem-solving abilities through an in-depth analysis of Zomato, a leading food delivery company in India. It includes database setup, data importing, handling null values, and addressing key business challenges using advanced SQL queries.
## Project Structure

- **Database Setup:** Creation of the `zomato_db` database and the required tables.
- **Data Import:** Inserting sample data into the tables.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling null values and ensuring data integrity.
- **Business Problems:** Solving 20 specific business problems using SQL queries.

## Database Setup
```sql
CREATE DATABASE zomato_db;
```

### 1. Dropping Existing Tables
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS deliveries;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Orders;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS customers;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS restaurants;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS riders;

### 2. Creating Tables

CREATE TABLE customers
		(customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
		customer_name VARCHAR(25),
		reg_date DATE
		);

CREATE TABLE restaurant
		(restaurant_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
		restaurant_name VARCHAR(55),
		city VARCHAR(55),
		opening_hours VARCHAR(55)
		);

CREATE TABLE orders
		(order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
		customer_id INT,--comes from customer table
		restaurant_id INT ,--comes from restaurant table
		order_item VARCHAR(100),
		order_date DATE,
		order_time TIME,
		order_status VARCHAR(55),
		total_amount FLOAT
		);

--adding constraints

ALTER TABLE orders
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_customers
FOREIGN KEY (customer_id)
REFERENCES customers(customer_id);


ALTER TABLE orders
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_restaurant
FOREIGN KEY (restaurant_id)
REFERENCES restaurant(restaurant_id);


CREATE TABLE riders
		(rider_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
		rider_name VARCHAR(55),
		sign_up DATE
		);

CREATE TABLE deliveries
		(delivery_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
		order_id INT,--comes from orders table
		delivery_status VARCHAR(55),
		delivery_time TIME,
		rider_id INT--comes from riders table
);

--adding constraints

ALTER TABLE deliveries
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_orders
FOREIGN KEY (order_id)
REFERENCES orders(order_id);

ALTER TABLE deliveries
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_riders
FOREIGN KEY (rider_id)
REFERENCES riders(rider_id);
```

The Entity-Relationship (ERD) model for this database is structured as follows

![ERD Zomato DB](https://github.com/daria2003-h/Zomato_SQL_project/blob/main/zomato_erd.png)

## Data Import

## Data Cleaning and Handling Null Values

Before performing analysis, I ensured that the data was clean and free from null values where necessary. For instance:

```sql
UPDATE orders
SET total_amount = COALESCE(total_amount, 0);
```

## Business Problems Solved
### 1.Top 5 most frequently ordered dishes
Write a query to find the top 5 most frequently ordered dishes by customer called "Aakash Dubey" in the last 1 year.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM
(SELECT 
		c.customer_id,
		c.customer_name,
		o.order_item,
		COUNT (*) AS total_orders,
		DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC ) AS rank
		FROM orders AS o
INNER JOIN customers AS c
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
		WHERE reg_date > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 Year' 
		AND 
		c.customer_name = 'Aakash Dubey'
		GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
		ORDER BY 2,4 DESC) as t1
WHERE rank <=5;
```
### 2. Popular Time Slots
Question: Identify the time slots during which the most orders are placed. based on 2-hour intervals.

Logic

-00:59:59 AM --then 0

-01:59:59 AM --then 1

Approach 1
```sql
SELECT 
 CASE
 	WHEN EXTRACT (HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 0 AND 1 THEN '00:00-02:00' 
	WHEN EXTRACT (HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 2 AND 3 THEN '02:00-04:00' 
	WHEN EXTRACT (HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 4 AND 5 THEN '04:00-06:00' 
	WHEN EXTRACT (HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 6 AND 7 THEN '06:00-08:00' 
	WHEN EXTRACT (HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 8 AND 9 THEN '08:00-10:00' 
	WHEN EXTRACT (HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 10 AND 11 THEN '10:00-12:00' 
	WHEN EXTRACT (HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 13 THEN '12:00-14:00' 
	WHEN EXTRACT (HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 14 AND 15 THEN '14:00-16:00' 
	WHEN EXTRACT (HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 16 AND 17 THEN '16:00-18:00'
	WHEN EXTRACT (HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 18 AND 19 THEN '18:00-20:00'
	WHEN EXTRACT (HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 20 AND 21 THEN '20:00-22:00' 
	WHEN EXTRACT (HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 22 AND 23 THEN '22:00-24:00' END AS time_slot,
COUNT(order_id) AS order_count
FROM orders
GROUP BY time_slot
ORDER BY order_count DESC;
```
Approach 2
```sql
SELECT
	FLOOR(EXTRACT (HOUR FROM order_time)/2)*2 AS start_time,
	FLOOR(EXTRACT (HOUR FROM order_time)/2)*2+2 AS end_time,
	COUNT (*) AS order_count 
FROM orders
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;
```
### 3. Order Value Analysis
Question: Find the average order value per customer who has placed more than 750 orders.
Return customer_name, and aov(average order value)
```sql
SELECT 
	c.customer_name, 
	COUNT(order_id) AS number_of_orders, 
	AVG(o.total_amount) AS average_order_value
FROM orders AS o
		JOIN customers AS c
		ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY 1
HAVING COUNT(order_id)> 750
ORDER BY number_of_orders DESC;
```
### 4. High-Value Customers
Question: List the customers who have spent more than 100K in total on food orders.
Return customer_name, and customer_id!
```sql
SELECT 
	o.customer_id,
	c.customer_name,

GROUP BY o.customer_id, c.customer_name
HAVING SUM(total_amount)> 100000
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;
```
### 5. Orders Without Delivery
Question: Write a query to find orders that were placed but not delivered. 
Return each restuarant name, city and number of not delivered orders 
```sql
SELECT 
	r.restaurant_id, 
	r.restaurant_name,
	r.city,
	COUNT(*) AS not_delivered
FROM orders AS o
	LEFT JOIN restaurant AS r

```
### 12. Customer Segmentation: 
Customer Segmentation: Segment customers into 'Gold' or 'Silver' groups based on their total spending 
compared to the average order value (AOV). If a customer's total spending exceeds the AOV, 
label them as 'Gold'; otherwise, label them as 'Silver'. 
Write an SQL query to determine each segment's 
total number of orders and total revenue
```sql
--Customer segmentation
